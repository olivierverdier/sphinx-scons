.. README file for sphinx-scons, in -*- rst -*- mode.

Introduction
============

This package contains :file:`SConstruct`, a generic SCons_ build script for
invoking Sphinx_ to build documentation.

The :program:`sphinx-quickstart` program can automatically create two build
scripts: a :file:`Makefile` for Unix systems, and a :file:`make.bat`
equivalent for Windows.  This script has the advantage that it works the
same way on both systems (once you have installed SCons).

Usage
=====

Basically, just copy the :file:`SConstruct` file to the top-level directory
of your Sphinx docs, and then use :program:`scons` at a command prompt to
build things.  Typing :command:`scons -h` will give a help message
describing all the things you can do.

As an example, if you just type :command:`scons` in this package's
directory, you can read this :file:`README` in style, รก la Sphinx.
